# Exploratory Data Analysis of Prenatal Smoking and Environmental Tobacco Smoke Exposure on Children


## Abstract
In collaboration with Dr. Lauren Micalizzi, this project aims to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis to investigate the impacts of smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure on children's substance use, externalizing behaviors, and self-regulation. Key aspects of the study include data preprocessing, addressing missing data, exploring demographic information and conducting extensive analysis to understand the relationship between prenatal/postnatal tobacco exposure and children's behavioral and self-regulation outcomes. The findings suggest a potential positive association between maternal smoking and childrenâ€™s substance use and externalizing behaviors. However, limitations like small sample size and substantial data missingness call for more rigorous future analyses.
